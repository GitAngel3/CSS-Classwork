    <h2>Poems</h2>
    <p>Poetry is song lyrics without the music? Writing that rhymes? 
        A bunch of comparisons and abstract imagery that feels like a code for 
        the reader to decipher?
The answer to all of the above is yes, but poetry encompasses much more.
 Poetry is a broad literary category that covers everything from bawdy limericks to
  unforgettable song lyrics to the sentimental couplets inside greeting cards. Poetry’s
   lack of rules can make it feel hard to define but is also what makes poetry enjoyable f
   or so many to write. If you’ve ever wondered how to write a poem, read on. Writing 
   poetry doesn’t have to be daunting—we’re going to demystify the process and walk you 
   through it, one step at a time.  </p>

   <p>A poem is a singular piece of poetry. Poems don’t have to rhyme;
they don’t have to fit any specific format; and they don’t have to use 
ny specific vocabulary or be about any specific topic. But here’s what
 they do have to do: use words artistically by employing figurative language.
With a poem, the form is as important as the function—perhaps even more so.
In contrast, prose is writing that follows the standard sentence and 
paragraph structure. Prose, while it takes many different forms and tones,
 largely mimics human speech patterns. </p>
